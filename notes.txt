basic fundamental
java code => compiler => byte code => jvm.
jvm will only execute 1 file that contain : public static void main(String a[]), and the rest will be executed as in that file.
name of class cant be prefix with number, must be same with name of file and must be has extension .java
to compile program :
1. terminal => javac name_file.java
2. using debug in the top
variable :
1. String
2. int

Data type :
primitive =>
1. integer => byte (1 bytes), short (2 bytes), int (4 bytes), long (8 bytes)
2. float => float (4 bytes), double (8 bytes)
3. character => char (2 bytes)
4. boolean => true or false

1 bytes maximum is 128;

conversion and casting
conversion  => change type of data directly
casting => change type of data with describe the type of data
type promotion => change type of data in the result of operation when the result cant match with the type of data

operational operator
< , > , == , != , <= , >=

logical operator
and => &&
or => ||
not => !

conditional operator
if - else
if - else if - else
ternary operator => only can be used for get the result, not doing something (assign data)
switch

looping
loop - while => execute code if the condition is true
do while => execute code minimum once when the condition is false
for

======================
object
object have properties and behaviors (what it can do)
object = pen
properties = color, merk
behaviors = write

to call the method in other class, we must declare the class first as object in the class which is called

======================
array
int arrVal[] = {5,6,7};
multi dimensional array
int multiArr[][]= new int [3][4]
jaged array => array which has no same length between array one and other
array of objects => array that contain object value

======================
String
Basically, String is an object that consume hype memory. When we insert value to String variable, the value can't be changed. ACtually, when we manipulated the value, java only change the address memory that refers for the value in the hype memory.
mutable string => can change the string
immutable string => can't change the string
String buffer & String builder => create mutable string, and both of them can be manipulated with so many methods 

======================
static
share by all of every object in the class, once we change the value, all of objects which are use that variable will affect with that
static block, will only called once although the object is used so many times
if we use static class, we can't use non static variable in.
in the main class, we use static because we don't need call the name of class to run main in the first time we run the program

======================
encapsulation
private => only can be accessed in the same class
to access the var private, we can create method to collect the var and use the method in other class. The method should be has prefix get (getter)
to assign value to the var private, we can create method to assign the var and use the method in other class. The method should be has prefix set (setter)
